# Kanji Classification

This is the practical part of a project that took place as part of the Deep Learning course at the Hasso Plattner Institute under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Lippert.
The goal of this lecture was to train a model with the data of [Kanji character](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anokas/kuzushiji). After training, we should use the model for transfer learning on the [Chinese MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/chinese-mnist). We were also advised to try alternatives to CNNs.
